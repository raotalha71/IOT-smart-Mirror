### **Assembly of Azure Services for the Smart Mirror Project**

Here's how all the components will work together, their workflows, and how they integrate seamlessly to achieve the functionalities for your **Smart Mirror** project:

---


### **1. Key Components and Their Roles**

#### **a. ESP32-CAM**

- **Role**: Captures images and sends them to Azure Blob Storage via Wi-Fi.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Detects a voice command trigger (e.g., "Hey Mirror, how do I look?").
    2. Captures an image and sends it to Azure Blob Storage using REST API.

#### **b. Azure Blob Storage**

- **Role**: Acts as a storage location for images captured by the ESP32-CAM.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Stores the uploaded images.
    2. Triggers an **Azure Function** upon a new image upload.

#### **c. Azure Function**

- **Role**: Serverless processing of data. Handles image analysis, user speech processing, and text-to-speech feedback.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Blob trigger: Detects new image uploads and processes them using **Computer Vision API**.
    2. HTTP trigger: Handles user queries or forwards text from **Speech-to-Text API** to AI services like **LUIS** or **OpenAI** for a response.

#### **d. Azure Cognitive Services**

- **Role**: Provides AI capabilities like image processing, language understanding, and text-to-speech conversion.
- **Key Services**:
    - **Computer Vision API**: Analyzes uploaded images (e.g., detects faces, objects, or emotions).
    - **Speech-to-Text API**: Converts spoken commands to text.
    - **LUIS (Language Understanding)**: Interprets the intent behind user queries.
    - **Text-to-Speech API**: Converts textual responses to natural-sounding audio.

#### **e. Azure IoT Hub**

- **Role**: Provides a communication bridge between ESP32-CAM and Azure services.
- **Workflow**:
    1. Receives commands or responses from Azure Functions.
    2. Sends back results to ESP32-CAM for further processing (e.g., displaying feedback or enabling text-to-speech playback).

#### **f. Speaker with PAM8610 Amplifier**

- **Role**: Outputs the voice response generated by **Text-to-Speech API**.
- **Workflow**: Plays the audio response sent back from ESP32-CAM.

### **2. Data Flow and Workflow**

#### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

1. **Voice Command Detection**:
    
    - The user speaks: _"Hey Mirror, how do I look?"_
    - **ESP32-CAM** (or MAX9814 microphone module) detects the voice input.
2. **Image Capture and Upload**:
    
    - ESP32-CAM captures an image.
    - The image is uploaded to **Azure Blob Storage** via REST API.
3. **Trigger Image Analysis**:
    
    - **Azure Blob Storage** triggers an **Azure Function** upon the image upload.
    - The function processes the image using **Computer Vision API**.
4. **Generate Feedback**:
    
    - The **Azure Function** uses the analysis results to generate a textual response (e.g., _"You look great today! Adding glasses would make it even better."_).
5. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**:
    
    - The **Azure Function** sends the text to **Text-to-Speech API**, which generates an audio file or stream.
6. **Send Audio to ESP32-CAM**:
    
    - The audio response is sent back to **ESP32-CAM** via **Azure IoT Hub** or a direct HTTP call.
    - ESP32-CAM plays the audio through the speaker connected to the **PAM8610 amplifier**.

### **3. How They Work Together**

|**Component**|**Input**|**Processing**|**Output**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**ESP32-CAM**|Voice command, image capture|Sends image to Blob Storage|Sends data to Blob or IoT Hub|
|**Azure Blob Storage**|Image from ESP32-CAM|Stores image, triggers Function on new upload|Triggers Azure Function|
|**Azure Function**|Trigger from Blob Storage/HTTP|Calls Cognitive Services (AI APIs)|Sends response back to IoT Hub|
|**Computer Vision API**|Image from Azure Function|Analyzes image for faces, objects, emotions|Returns analysis result|
|**LUIS**|Text queries from HTTP trigger|Detects intent of query|Returns intent and response|
|**Text-to-Speech API**|Text from Function|Converts text to audio|Returns audio file/stream|
|**Speaker System**|Audio from ESP32-CAM|Amplifies and outputs sound|Plays voice feedback|

### **4. Setting Up Azure Services in Azure Panel**

#### **Step 1: Azure Blob Storage**

1. Create a **Blob Storage Account** (if not already created).
2. Create a **container** for storing images (e.g., `images`).
3. Enable **Event Grid** for triggering Azure Functions on blob uploads.

#### **Step 2: Azure IoT Hub**

1. Create an **IoT Hub**.
2. Register the **ESP32-CAM** device in the IoT Hub.
3. Use the **Device Connection String** to link the ESP32-CAM to IoT Hub for sending and receiving data.

#### **Step 3: Azure Functions**

1. Create a **Function App**.
2. Add **Blob Storage Trigger** for image processing.
3. Add **HTTP Trigger** for speech queries or responses.

#### **Step 4: Cognitive Services APIs**

1. Create and configure the following services:
    - **Computer Vision API**: For image analysis.
    - **LUIS**: For understanding natural language queries.
    - **Text-to-Speech API**: For generating audio responses.
    - **Speech-to-Text API** (optional): For converting voice to text.

#### **Step 5: Integrate Services**

1. In **Azure Functions**, write code to call the APIs.
2. Use IoT Hub to communicate between the cloud and ESP32.
