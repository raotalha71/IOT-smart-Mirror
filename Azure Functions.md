### **Azure Functions** (Optional) - Overview


**Azure Functions** is a **serverless computing** service offered by Microsoft Azure. It allows you to run small pieces of code (functions) without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. The functions are triggered by specific events or conditions, and you only pay for the time your code runs, making it efficient for certain tasks where you don’t want to maintain a full backend service.

For your **Smart Mirror** project, **Azure Functions** can be used to handle specific processes like analyzing images or processing user queries in a serverless manner. You can trigger a function based on events like an image being uploaded or a user speaking to the system.

### **What Would Azure Functions Do in Your Project?**

Here's how **Azure Functions** would work in your **Smart Mirror** project:

1. **Trigger on Image Upload (Blob Storage Trigger)**:
    
    - When the **ESP32-CAM** captures an image and uploads it to **Azure Blob Storage**, you can set up an **Azure Function** that gets triggered whenever a new image is uploaded to the storage.
    - The function can then call the **Computer Vision API** to analyze the image (e.g., detect faces, objects, or text in the image).
    - Based on the result of the image analysis, you can make decisions or actions. For example, if the image shows a person, you could use the **Text-to-Speech** service to say something like, "I see a person smiling."
2. **Trigger Based on User Speech (Speech Recognition Trigger)**:
    
    - When the user speaks (via **Speech-to-Text**), an Azure Function can be triggered to process the speech.
    - The function can send the text to **LUIS** (Language Understanding) to identify user intents (e.g., asking a question, requesting weather information).
    - Based on the response from **LUIS**, you can use **Text-to-Speech** to provide an audio answer to the user.

### **How to Set Up Azure Functions in the Azure Panel**

Here’s the procedure to set up **Azure Functions** in the Azure Portal for your project:

#### **Step 1: Create an Azure Function App**

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**.
2. **Search for "Function App"** in the search bar at the top and click on it.
3. **Click "Create"** to start the process of creating a new function app.
4. Fill in the required details:
    - **Subscription**: Choose your subscription.
    - **Resource Group**: Select your existing resource group (e.g., `IOT_Project_Smart_Mirror`) or create a new one.
    - **Function App Name**: Give your function app a unique name (e.g., `SmartMirrorFunctionApp`).
    - **Runtime Stack**: Select the runtime stack you want to use (e.g., **Node.js** or **Python** for easy integration with Azure APIs).
    - **Region**: Choose the same region as your other services for consistency and performance.
5. **Click "Review + Create"**, review your settings, and click **Create** to deploy the function app.

#### **Step 2: Create a Function**

Once the **Function App** is created, you can start adding functions:

1. Go to the **Function App** you just created.
    
2. Under the **Functions** section, click **+ Add** to create a new function.
    
3. You will be prompted to choose a trigger. A trigger is what starts the function.
    
    Here are two common scenarios for your project:
    
    - **Blob Trigger** (for image processing when an image is uploaded):
        - Select **Blob Storage trigger**.
        - In the **Settings**:
            - **Storage Account**: Choose your storage account.
            - **Blob path**: Define the folder path within your storage where images are uploaded (e.g., `images/{name}`).
        - Click **Create**.
    - **HTTP Trigger** (for speech or bot interaction):
        - Select **HTTP trigger** to allow the function to be called over an HTTP request (this can be triggered when you send data from **ESP32**).
        - Click **Create**.

#### **Step 3: Write the Code for Your Function**

You can write the function code directly in the **Azure Portal** or use a local editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and deploy it to Azure.

1. **For Blob Trigger (Image Processing)**: You can write code that will be triggered when a new image is uploaded to your Blob Storage. The function can:
    
    - Download the image.
    - Call the **Computer Vision API** to analyze the image.
    - Store the results or use the result to take further actions.
    - Optionally, use **Text-to-Speech** to provide audio feedback.
    
    Example (Python code for Blob Trigger):
    
    ```python
    import logging
    import azure.functions as func
    from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient
    import requests
    
    def main(myblob: func.InputStream):
        image_data = myblob.read()
        image_url = upload_to_blob_storage(image_data)  # Function to upload image to blob
        analysis = analyze_image(image_url)  # Call Computer Vision API
        feedback = generate_feedback(analysis)  # Generate feedback (e.g., "Person detected")
        output_audio(feedback)  # Convert feedback to speech (Text-to-Speech)
        
    def upload_to_blob_storage(image_data):
        # Code to upload image data to Blob storage
        pass
    
    def analyze_image(image_url):
        # Code to call Computer Vision API to analyze image
        pass
    
    def generate_feedback(analysis):
        # Generate a textual response based on image analysis
        return "I see a person smiling!"
    
    def output_audio(feedback):
        # Code to convert text to speech using Azure Speech API
        pass
    ```
    
2. **For HTTP Trigger (User Query Processing)**: This trigger can process text from the user (e.g., a question or request for information). You can send the input to **LUIS** or **Bot Services** for processing.
    
    Example (Node.js code for HTTP Trigger):
    
    ```javascript
    module.exports = async function (context, req) {
        const query = req.query.text;
        const response = await processQuery(query);  // Call LUIS or Bot API
        context.res = {
            body: response
        };
    };
    
    async function processQuery(query) {
        // Code to send the query to LUIS and get a response
        return "The weather today is sunny.";
    }
    ```
    

#### **Step 4: Test and Deploy the Function**

1. Once the function is created, you can test it directly from the Azure Portal by sending sample data (e.g., an image URL for image processing or a query for speech processing).
2. After testing, you can integrate the **Azure Function** with your **ESP32** or other components.

### **What Does This Achieve for Your Project?**

- **Event-driven Processing**: The **Azure Function** can be triggered by events like uploading images to Blob Storage or receiving speech input. This provides an automatic flow of processing without needing to manually trigger the actions.
    
- **Image Analysis**: Using **Computer Vision API**, the function can analyze the image and extract useful information (e.g., detecting faces or objects).
    
- **Real-time Feedback**: Based on the image analysis or user query, the function can generate a **Text-to-Speech** response, allowing the mirror to speak back to the user.
    
- **Serverless and Scalable**: With **Azure Functions**, you don’t need to worry about maintaining a dedicated server. It scales automatically, and you only pay for the actual function execution time.

### **Conclusion**

In your **Smart Mirror** project:

- **Azure Functions** will help you offload tasks like image analysis or speech recognition without the need for a full server setup.
- The **function** will automatically trigger when new images are uploaded or when a user interacts via speech, making your project dynamic and responsive.
- You can use **Azure Cognitive Services** (like **Computer Vision**, **Speech API**, and **LUIS**) within the function to process data and generate appropriate responses.
